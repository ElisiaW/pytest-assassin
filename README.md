# Pytest-Assassin

  ![picture](images/assassinpic.jpg)

  Pytest-Assassin is a plugin for pytest that allows users to have the ability
  to check and see if their test cases contain assert statements or not. This
  will help with the problem of useless test cases that are not doing anything
  for the program.

## Features

  Welcome to Pytest-Assassin! Here at Pytest-Assassin, we want to destroy the
  code that is wrong for your program. Our key features are checking for asserts
  and function calls within your test cases. While this seems like something
  to pass up, we can assure you that this is exactly what you want. We are
  sure that mostly everyone has written a test case that either assert nothing
  or makes sure that a container, if you will, is filled. While the latter
  is not bad, it is not what a program needs! A program needs test cases that will
  run through the function, take the expected output and compare it to the actual
  output. So in other words, a program needs Pytest Assassin!
